SCARF (SCAR Finder) SCAR marker creator code and documentation

This repository contains code and its documentation for the software package called SCARF - SCAR Finder.  It analyzes two or more genomes for length-polymorphic regions bounded by unique sequences, and designs PCR primers within these sequences.  The primers can be used to amplify the region from genomic DNA of any of the species used to create the markers, and the amplicon size will indicate which species the DNA came from - a SCAR marker.  SCAR stands for Sequence Characterized Amplified Regions.  SCAR markers were first defined here:

Paran, I., and R. W. Michelmore. "Development of reliable PCR-based markers linked to downy mildew resistance genes in lettuce." Theoretical and Applied Genetics 85.8 (1993): 985-993.

SCARF was described in:

To download and install SCARF, follow the instructions in INSTALL.txt.

To run SCARF and generate markers after installing it, follow the instructions in RUN.txt.
